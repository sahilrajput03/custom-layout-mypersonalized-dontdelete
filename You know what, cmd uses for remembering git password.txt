And it must work with that, if that doesn't pick up from there, you can manually set credential 
for git in the window credentials manager, (though entering password for once via git-bash
saves the credentials to windows credentials manger though, but sometimes cmd just doesn't 
pick it up, so save there manually(see some articles like - https://snede.net/git-does-not-remember-username-password/ )
That article worked perfectly in my case though. Though, it should be working without putting 
it manually there, coz git-bash does it. But anyhow we care to make it work cmd, coz I have
script for cmd though.
